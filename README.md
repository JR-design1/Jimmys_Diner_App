# About This Project
This project is the front end of a web app to order items from a restraunt, called Jimmy's Diner. It works by adding items to the order, pressing a complete order button, and entering credit card information on a form. Then, it gives the user a confirmation message! 

### Project Features
<ul>
    <li>
        If the user changes their mind and wants to edit their order after they press the "Complete Order" button, they can by pressing the shift key and clicking outside the modal to prevent the modal from               accidentally closing.
    </li>
    <li>The user must enter the inputs into the form in the modal in the correct format.</li>
    <li>When the order is placed, more items can not be added to the order until the button saying "Place a new order" is clicked.</li>
    <li>Items that respond to click events change the cursor to pointer on hover to enhance user experience.</li>
    <li>The user can remove items from their order by clicking the remove button.</li>
</ul>
